            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This site is for you small creators, that want to step foot to the world of content creation. No fancy words or yapping. Let’s get you right in!</p>

            <h2>First Videos and 100 Subs</h2>
            <p>Okay, so you just started a channel! The only problem is that you don’t know what to do. Don’t do some overkill video if you don’t want. A simple video will do, because it’s very unlikely to get more than 10 views. Try YouTube shorts and many variations of content. Capitalize on the popular content and growth. The sub count will start to accumulate!</p>

        <section id="100-subs">
            <h2>100 Subs - A New Universe</h2>
            <p>After 100 subs, you feel like being at the top of the world! But it’s not over. Try to have steady growth with new videos and more variety. Remember not to stick to one topic, because it will limit the possibilities for new content. YouTube Shorts are a great way for growing your channel. Try to have catchy titles that attract the algorithm. Also, trendy music will help. Hashtags are not as important, so with a good title, music, and of course the video, you are pretty much good to go!</p>
